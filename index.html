                        <h2>Food</h2>
                        <p>China is a huge country with rich and varied cuisine. The country is well known for its jiaozi, or dumplings, served with vinegar, soy sauce, and fresh garlic. Then there is the blander food from the southern Cantonese region, typified by dim sum. We can't forget the spicy food the Sichuan province is known for, either! There is something to suit every taste in China. Though I enjoy food from all the areas I visited, my favorite overall is northern cuisine. The sauces and flavors are incredible, and transform simple ingredients like potatoes, eggplant, and green peppers into a dish that makes my mouth water years later just thinking about it. One of my favorites is in the picture below, cuipi rousi juan. Of course, even the most delicious of food can sometimes have a presentation that Westerners might consider unusual!</p>

                        <h2>Harbin Snow and Ice Festival</h2>
                        <p>Every year, tourists flock to Harbin, China for the Snow and Ice Festival. It is amazing what they are able to create just using ice and lights. Each year the creations are different. As you might imagine, the temperature in Harbin is quite cold. In fact, it can reach -40 and below. A fun factoid that I learned there is that -40 is the point at which Celcius and Fahreinheit meet. Heavy winter gear is advised, and if you hate being cold like I do, load up on heat patches that adhere to your base layer, available in the local drugstore.</p>

                        <h2>The Great Wall</h2>
                        <p>The Great Wall is probably the most famous symbol of China and its long and vivid history. The name is slightly deceptive, as it is a series of walls totaling more than 13,000 miles in length. The area that is still fairly well-preserved and draws the most visitors is located a couple of hours outside the capital of Beijing. There is a Chinese saying that "He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man." If that's the case, then the long steep hike up the wall both wore me out and proved I'm a true man!</p>

                        <h2>Random Chinese awesomeness</h2>
                        <p>No visit to China would be complete without pictures of the random weird but awesome things that you see on a daily basis. Whether it's the zip ties holding the bus seats together or the mannequin legs without a top half that appeared one morning, casually leaning against the tree, there is always something to amuse and confuse. Below are a few that I got photos of.</p>
